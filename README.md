## What is this?

This is a gopher server written in golang.

## Why is this?

It felt appropriate.

## Is it secure?

Probably not, but I'm running it anyway: 

```
gopher://djpetersen.com
```

## What does it support?

Right now it supports text documents and gophermaps. I'm planning to support links, sound, and images soon.
